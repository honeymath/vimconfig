# Fucking plan.

## establishing and testing for channel.py
Establish a socket client connected to mac-mini llmos app.py which is sending messages, (the channel.py have to print the message upon received) the other client requests for inputs and send the inputed message back to the client. An example is, I believe when I fucking click the double, it should be something popa outa.

Also try another approach to estabilish a socket client directly to the service provided by channel.py

## testing and establishing the loop in VIm

send a specific message to vim, and when vimworker receive that message wait the input from the vim worker. rEtuRN thE wHOlE bUFfEr. ThIS iNput aND ouTput cAN bE gENErAtEd bY anOtheR thrEad.


## next plans

1. update the build pdf logic, after the command runs, run the drawer, it auto gunzip the gz file and fucking parse it, establish the static filder, and put necessary jsons, synctex, and pdfs, and activate forward search process, by input the current buffer filepath and line, and use it output to curl, activate a socket that I established before. 


2. Build the backwards search logic, when receiving a data, got page, x, y and run the backwards search script get filepath and lines and call vim to run it. 


... need worker.vim support the following:

readbufferprotocal:  X    

buffer write protocal: may receive a start num, end num, and replaced data, needs to replace the start num until end numb by the data specified.   R 100 101 textfucking....

open file protocal: receive a filepath and a line number open that file.  E FILEPATH:linenum

then aline the coordinate properly and use it.

### next next plans

should add the task doing logic in channel.py....    run the python code and return the result. using the same format for the result as before.

should enable ai write and edit function, rewrite the program, give it a new name, and modify the mama's send task send a task with new name.  yes, just obtain the whole buffer and it.
